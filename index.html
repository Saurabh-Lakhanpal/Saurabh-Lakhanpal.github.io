                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>I was working with TD on the ISO20022 compliance project. I started as a BSA for the core engineering team, where we owned the payment engine itself and the engine isolation end point. I was leading and supported by a business analyst and a BSA in a SCRUM team. We dealt with technical user stories for a new ACI MTF/UPF Swift/fed wire ISO2022 compliant modern payment engine. My job was to manage the backlog, capture and document user stories, coordinate with various upstream and downstream partners, and ensure that we follow the critical path of the project.
                        <br />
                        <br />Later, we changed to a PDLC approach with a new initiative of upgrading the existing Finestra's Payplus wire solution to ISO compliance. Here again, along with many other project activities, we owned the detailed level technical requirements. We mapped the process, created many artifacts like sequence diagrams to scope out the future state. Multiple technologies and interactions were involved where we defined how the wire engine will handle the new pacs and camt messages.
